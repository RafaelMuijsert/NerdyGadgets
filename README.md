# NerdyGadgets

A beautiful webshop that just worksâ„¢ on my machine.


## Project structure
Please see https://github.com/php-pds/skeleton

## Dependencies
- A web server (apache is preferred)
- PHP (tested with version 7.4+)
- mysqli php extension
- intl php extension
- Composer

## Setup
### Manual setup
Edit php.ini and add the following line under [PHP]:
```
extension=intl
```
If you are using XAMPP, the mysqli extension should be enabled by default. 
If this is not the case, or if you are hosting the server a different way, repeat the above step with the mysqli extension.

Lastly, install the composer dependencies by navigating to the project root and running the following command:
```bash
$ composer install
```

Copy the .env.example file to .env and update the variables.

Make sure the web server root is set to public/ and not to the project root.

### Using Docker
Build the image by navigating to the project directory and running the following command
```bash
$ docker build -t nerdygadgets .
```
Then you can run the image using `docker run`
```bash
$ docker run -p 80:80 -t nerdygadgets
```


### Using docker-compose (recommended)
Provided below are a couple of example docker-compose files.
Don't forget to create a .env file containing all deployment-specific variables. 
It is recommended that you copy the .env.example file found in the project root.
